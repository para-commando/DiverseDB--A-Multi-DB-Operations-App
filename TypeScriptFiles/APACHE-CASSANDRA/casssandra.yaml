# The name of the cluster. This is mainly used to prevent machines in
# one logical cluster from joining another.
cluster_name: 'Test Cluster'

# The number of tokens randomly assigned to this node in a cluster that uses virtual nodes (vnodes). This setting is evaluated in relation to the num_tokens set on other nodes in the cluster. If this node's num_tokens value is higher than the values on other nodes, the vnode logic assigns this node a larger proportion of data relative to other nodes. In general, if all nodes have equal hardware capability, each one should have the same num_tokens value . The recommended value is 256. If this property is commented out (#num_tokens), Cassandra uses 1 (equivalent to #num_tokens : 1) for legacy compatibility and assigns tokens using the initial_token property.
# If this cluster is not using vnodes, comment out num_tokens or set num_tokens: 1 and use initial_token.
num_tokens: 256

# this is node-specific
# The listen_address in Cassandra's configuration specifies the IP address or hostname the node uses to connect to other nodes. Key considerations:
# Single-Node: For single-node setups, comment out this property or use the default (localhost).
# Multi-Node: In multi-node setups, set listen_address to the node's IP or hostname.
# Multi-Network: In complex setups with multiple networks or data centers, configure listen_address accordingly.
# Caution: Never set listen_address to 0.0.0.0; it's always incorrect.
# Exclusive Setting: Do not set both listen_address and listen_interface on the same node; choose one or the other.

# listen_address: 172.17.0.2

# This approach abstracts away the need to specify an IP address directly and simply tells Cassandra to use the network interface named eth0.
# It can be more convenient in situations where the network interface name (eth0) is stable and less likely to change, especially in static or well-configured environments.
# It's a way to delegate the responsibility of choosing the IP address to the system's network configuration.
# If your network setup is relatively stable and you want a more abstract way to specify the network interface without worrying about IP address changes, then using listen_interface can be more convenient.
# Note that this doesn't support ip-aliasing, IP aliasing is a technique used in computer networking to assign multiple IP addresses to a single network interface (NIC) on a computer or network device. This technique allows a single NIC to have multiple IP addresses associated with it, each serving different purposes or used for specific network-related tasks. 

listen_interface: eth0

# If an interface has an ipv4 and an ipv6 address, Cassandra uses the first ipv4 address by default. Set this property to true to configure Cassandra to use the first ipv6 address.
# since ipv6 is more improved version when compared to ipv4 hence set as true
listen_interface_prefer_ipv6: true

# while the commit log and CDC log directories should be within the same filesystem for management reasons, it's also a common practice to consider placing the commit log on a separate storage device or partition to improve write performance and data durability, especially in production environments with high write workloads.

# the data_file_directories setting is used to specify the directories where Cassandra stores its data files, including SSTables (Sorted String Table files). SSTables are the primary on-disk storage format for data in Cassandra.

# Here's an explanation of the data_file_directories setting:

# data_file_directories: This is a list of one or more directory paths where Cassandra will store its data files. You can specify multiple directories by separating them with commas. Cassandra will evenly distribute the data across these directories, helping to balance the I/O load.
# Having multiple data directories can help distribute the I/O load across multiple devices or disks, improving both read and write performance and increasing fault tolerance. It can also be useful when you have different types of storage devices (e.g., SSDs and HDDs) and want to allocate specific keyspaces or column families to different storage types based on their performance requirements.
